\section{Lessons Learned}

In the course of this project were some lessons to be learned for us:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Working with large data sets} Getting the desired information from large datasets proved to take longer than expected. Especially the required steps before integrating the weather data take a long time.
	\item \textbf{Data may consist of errors or have missing parts} The assumption that data from a legitimate source is flawless is definitely wrong. For instance, we found out that there are no terror entries for the year 1993.
	\item \textbf{Some formats are difficult to work with} The less known format \texttt{dly} used for storing weather measurements posed some difficulties because it had to be read manually. Therefore a documentation of the formats' structure was necessary and had to be studied before being able to access the contained data.
\end{itemize}
